        <p>The documentary The Last Dance, a recent Netflix and ESPN collaboration, is hype. Although I’m a basketball fan, I don’t know much about the specific story of Michael Jordan, so this documentary felt more like a drama to me, with all the plot points being engaging. And it also takes admiration for the ESPN team’s connections to get the camera into the Chicago Bulls’ locker room.</p>
<p>There is one story that is pretty impressive to me. In the first episode, Bulls general manager Jerry Krause informed head coach Phil Jackson that this season was his final season coaching the Bulls in 1997-1998 pre-season. Jerry Krause as the head of management, the farce with Phil Jackson and Michael Jordan’s team is an open secret. However, Phil Jackson also gladly accepted the final year of his contract and set the theme for the final season, The Last Dance, to achieve the team’s sixth title.</p>

<p>I don’t know if it’s the cultural differences between East and West or personal professional attitudes. I really appreciate the professionalism of this team, they can tell each other directly to their face that I hate you, however, all the personal emotions don’t affect the team’s plan to win the title, everything is planned step by step. On the other hand, if this happens in the East, most people may quit their jobs and avoid working with people they don’t like; or they may go into a job or project with anger and imagine how bad the results will be.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s not necessary to have much skill, bring a professional attitude and things have basically worked out.</p>
